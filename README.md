# `filing-history-data-api`

## Summary

The `filing-history-data-api` is a service that receives filing history deltas from
`filing-history-data-consumer`. It transforms these deltas to a standardised structure and then:

* stores or deletes documents within the `company_filing_history collection` in MongoDB, and
* enqueues a resource changed message that triggers further downstream processing.

The service is implemented in Java 21 using Spring Boot 3.2

## System requirements
